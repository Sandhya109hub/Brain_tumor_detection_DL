# Brain_tumor_detection_DL
CNN-based Tumor Detection: The repository provides an implementation of a CNN model trained on a dataset of brain MRI images. The model is designed to classify images as tumor or non-tumor, enabling effective tumor detection.

This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive implementation of a Brain Tumor Detection system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a Flask-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). The system aims to assist medical professionals in accurately identifying brain tumors from MRI scans.

Key Features:

CNN-Based Brain Tumor Detection: The repository provides a detailed implementation of a CNN model trained on a large dataset of brain MRI images. The model has been designed to classify images into tumor and non-tumor classes, enabling accurate detection of brain tumors.

Flask GUI Integration: The system leverages the Flask web framework to create an intuitive and user-friendly GUI. The GUI allows users to upload brain MRI images, which are then processed and classified by the trained CNN model. The results are displayed promptly, aiding in efficient tumor diagnosis.

Model Training and Evaluation: The repository includes code and documentation for training the CNN model using annotated brain MRI datasets. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, providing insights into its accuracy and reliability.

Dataset Preparation: The repository offers guidance on preparing and organizing brain MRI datasets for training and testing the CNN model. Detailed instructions are provided to ensure seamless integration with the existing codebase.

Model Deployment: The repository provides instructions and scripts for deploying the trained CNN model along with the Flask GUI. This enables users to deploy the system on their local machines or host it on a web server for broader accessibility.

Contributions:

Contributions to the repository are encouraged and welcomed. Developers and researchers can contribute by improving the CNN model's performance, enhancing the GUI functionality, or expanding the dataset used for training and testing. Additionally, any bug fixes, optimizations, or feature additions would be highly appreciated.

Usage:

The repository includes detailed documentation and step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment, training the model, running the Flask GUI, and deploying the system. Users can refer to the documentation for comprehensive guidance on utilizing the system effectively.

We believe that this Brain Tumor Detection system will be a valuable tool in the medical field, aiding healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses and providing timely treatments for patients.
